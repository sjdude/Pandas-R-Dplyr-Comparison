# Introduction:
This is a Jupyter notebook that runs Python and R code(using Rpy2) listing and comparing the commonly used methods from a Python/Pandas user's perspective.

# Objective:
This notebook should serve as a useful reference/cheat sheet for people who need to work on a project with both Python and R at the same time.

## Things to note:
* Ensure you have R installed on your computer.
* Ensure that your 'R_HOME' environmental variable is set to the folder where your R is installed.
